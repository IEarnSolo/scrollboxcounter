- **Max clue scroll display**: Shows maximum clue scroll boxes at the bottom of clue scroll boxes in your bank and inventory
- **Full stack warning**: Highlights the counter in red when you've reached the maximum capacity
- **Shows banked count**: Displays the number of clue scroll boxes you currently have in your bank (**only after you have visited a bank**)
- **Displays a game chat message**: When you get a clue scroll box, it will show the number of boxes you are currently holding and the maximum you can hold
